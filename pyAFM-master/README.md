AFM and AFM+S in Python
=======================

This is a python implementation of the Additive Factors Model (Cenn, 2009) and
The Additive Factors Model with Slipping Paramters (MacLellan et al., 2015).
Wherever possible I tried to maintain scikit-learn convention, so that the code
would be compatible with their helper functions (e.g., for cross validation).

custom\_logistic.py is an estimator that can be used to implement AFM.
bounded\_logistic.py is an estimator that can be used to implement AFM+S.

process\_datashop.py can be used to read a student step or transaction export
from [DataShop](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/) and to run AFM and AFM+S on
it. Alternatively, the data can be passed to the scripts as long as it adheres
to the [tab-delimited DataShop
format](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/help?page=importFormatTd).This script
can be called with the -h argument to get details on supported arguments. By
default the script runs AFM+S when passed a student step export from Datashop;
e.g., `$ python process_datashop.py student_step_datashop_export.txt`

plot\_datashop.py can be used to plot student learning curves with the learning
curves predicted by AFM and AFM+S. Similar to process\_datashop.py, it accepts
student step files in datashop format; e.g., 
`$ python plot_datashop.py student_step_datashop_export.txt`

For a slightly more detailed example of how to use these scripts see my 
[blog post](http://christopia.net/blog/modeling-student-learning-in-python).

What sort of data is needed to run this?
=======================
Step Trans 6 is a tab delimited file that shows the type of fields needed to run it.

How to run this?
=======================
python .\process_datashop.py .\StepTranv6.txt -m AFM -nfolds 3
